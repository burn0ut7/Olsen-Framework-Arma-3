# Paraflare Module
## Authors: Tinfoilhate and StatusRed

This script allows users to ACE self-interact and have an option to launch flares into the sky.
While you can use handflares to throw and M203 flares, these are inventory parachute flares which take up little room, light weight, and are cool.

Add the following flares to your classes/roles in your loadout file and that's it, no further editing of settings is needed.
* FlareWhite_F
* FlareGreen_F
* FlareYellow_F
* FlareRed_F
